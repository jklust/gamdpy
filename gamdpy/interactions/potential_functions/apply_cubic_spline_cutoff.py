def apply_cubic_spline_cutoff(pair_potential):
    r""" Apply cubic spline cutoff to a pair-potential function

    Actually the cubic spline is applied to the pair force as done by LAMMPS
    (see https://docs.lammps.org/pair_lj_smooth.html).
    The potential energy is given by a quartic function in the transition region.
    Specifically, if :math:`u(r)` is the original potential, then the (modified) truncated potential is

    .. math::
       u_m(r) = u(r) + K \quad (r < r_i),

    .. math::
       u_m(r) = C_0 + C_1 [r-r_i] + \frac{C_2}{2} [r-r_i]^2 + \frac{C_3}{3} [r-r_i]^3 + \frac{C_4}{4} [r-r_i]^4 \quad (r_i \le r \le r_c),

    and

    .. math::
       u_m(r) = 0 \quad (r > r_c),

    The parameters (the :math:`C`'s and the :math:`K`) for a smooth truncation are computed automatically:
    At the inner cutoff radius, the force and its first derivative match the unsmoothed potential (:math:`u(r)`).
    At the outer cutoff radius, both the force and the first derivative are zero.

    The last two values of the parameter array (`params`) are the inner and outer cutoffs: `[..., r_i, r_c]`.

    Parameters
    ----------
        pair_potential: callable
            a function that calculates a pair-potential:
            u, s, umm =  pair_potential(dist, params)

    Returns
    -------

        potential: callable
            a function where a cubic spline cutoff is applied to original function

    """

    # Cut-off by computing potential twice, avoiding changes to params
    # Note: calls original potential function  twice each time, avoiding changes to params.
    # The four coefficients of the spline are also computed each time, along with the two energy
    # shift constants, which results in a small but noticeable performance cost.
